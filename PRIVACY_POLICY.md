# Privacy Policy for Weeknum

**Last Updated:** February 26, 2026

The **Weeknum** application is designed to be a simple, privacy-focused utility. This policy outlines how your data is handled.

---

## 1. Minimal Data Collection
**Weeknum does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

* **Personal Data:** We do not collect names, email addresses, or unique device identifiers.
* **Usage Statistics:** We do not use third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase) to track how you use the app.
* **Input Data:** Any date calculations or inputs happen entirely on your local device.

## 2. Device Permissions
The app is built to function with minimal access to your private information.
* **Internet Access:** The app requires permission to access the internet solely to fetch historical data for the "On This Day" feature.
* **No Private Access:** The app does not access your location, contacts, camera, microphone, or local files.

## 3. Network Connectivity & Third-Party Requests
**Weeknum connects to the internet for a single specific purpose.**

* **Wikipedia Integration:** The app connects to Wikipedia (specifically the "On this day" curated data) to display historical events relevant to the current date.
* **No Tracking:** While a request is made to Wikipedia's servers to pull this information, no user-specific data or app usage patterns are sent during this process.
* **No External Servers:** The app does not send data to any developer-owned servers or third-party advertisers.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Because the app utilizes Wikipedia to provide content, your device's IP address may be visible to Wikipedia (Wikimedia Foundation) during the data fetch, subject to their [Privacy Policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Policy:Privacy_policy). No data is shared with advertisers or data brokers.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
If the functionality of the app changes in a future update that requires further data processing, this policy will be updated. However, the core philosophy remains: if the data isn't needed for the app to work, we won't ask for it.

## 6. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue in this GitHub repository or contact the developer via the app store listing.
