# Privacy Policy for weeknum

**Last Updated:** February 15, 2026

The **Weeknum** application is designed to be a simple, privacy-focused utility. This policy outlines how your data is handled (or, in this case, how it isn't).

---

## 1. No Data Collection
**Weeknum does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.**

* **Personal Data:** We do not collect names, email addresses, IP addresses, or unique device identifiers.
* **Usage Statistics:** We do not use third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase) to track how you use the app.
* **Input Data:** Any date calculations or inputs happen entirely on your local device.

## 2. No Device Permissions
The app is built to function without accessing your private information. It requires **zero permissions** to operate, meaning it has no access to your:
* Location
* Contacts
* Camera or Microphone
* Files, Media, or Storage

## 3. No Network Connectivity
**Weeknum is an offline-only application.**

* The app does not connect to the internet to pull data.
* The app does not send data to any external servers or APIs.
* All logic for calculating week numbers is contained within the local application code.

## 4. Third-Party Services
Because the app does not connect to the internet or utilize external SDKs, no data is ever shared with third-party service providers or advertisers.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
If the functionality of the app changes in a future update that requires data processing, this policy will be updated. However, the core philosophy remains: if the data isn't needed for the app to work, we won't ask for it.

## 6. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue in this GitHub repository or contact the developer via the app store listing.
